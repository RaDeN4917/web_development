<h1 id="ab">Electronic Gadgets</h1>

<h2 id="ac">The field of electronics is a branch of physics and electrical engineering that deals with the emission, behaviour and effects of electrons using electronic devices.<br>
Electronics uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification, which distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering, which only uses passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance to control electric current flow.<br>
Electronics has hugely influenced the development of modern society.<br> 
The central driving force behind the entire electronics industry is the semiconductor industry sector, which has annual sales of over $481 billion as of 2018.<br>

<h3 id="ad"> <p style="color:red;">NOTE:</p>In the present world, some technologically savvy people have become hackers.<br> 
Therefore, your data is not at all safe with you.<br>												
With the help of the latest technologies, they may hack your computer, bank accounts, office data, and much more from the comfort of their home.<br>
Now that there is a substantial chance of fraud, online sharing of OTP and other information is perilous.<br>									
It's more likely for data to end up in the hands of terrorists, hackers, criminals, and other foreign adversaries when even a single piece of information is shared online.</h3>
